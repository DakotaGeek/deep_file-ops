# deep 
By Neil Gunton - Extensible Perl script for recursively traversing directories, performing operations on files - see http://www.neilgunton.com/doc/deep for the original.  (Copied here for my personal "bookmark")

## Overview and download
A powerful and extensible Perl script which recursively traverses subdirectories, processing files that match a given filename pattern. There are different commands, which are summarized below. The script is free; anyone may use it with no restrictions. The author would appreciate it if you could retain the author attribution and a link to his home page if you copy or redistribute it. He would much prefer that you contact him if you have tweaks, rather than posting modified versions elsewhere - because then we can have one version that will be kept up-to-date with any further fixes, rather than having multiple, slightly different ones floating around.
### Important: 
You should try this script out on a test directory, preferably a copy of your real data, before using it on real files. Always keep backups of your work in case you make a mistake. The whole point of the deep utility is that it automatically traverses deep directories, potentially substantially deleting or changing files. It's so easy to make backups - please do!
